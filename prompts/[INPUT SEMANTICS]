[INPUT SEMANTICS]
I am working on {subject} using the {technical stack} deployed on {destination}. The {type of system} interacts with {another part of the system} by {describe how the interaction works}.

[OUTPUT CUSTOMIZATION]
You're an expert in {subject}.

I need to achieve {describe the problem}. 
I understand that I need to perform {list actions} to solve it. 
Please provide a complete sequence of steps, including relevant code snippets.

Ensure you:
1. Fill in any missing steps.
2. Identify and remove unnecessary steps.
3. Visualize the impact of changes (time and space complexity, Pareto Chats, Heatmaps) when possible (e.g., code snippets, frameworks, or graphs). If visualization is not supported, simply omit it.

Take time to consider the problem deeply and provide the best possible solution.

[ERROR IDENTIFICATION]
When providing answers, list the facts that your solution depends on and should be fact-checked. These facts should only relate to the subject area and be relevant to the solution.

For each software framework or approach recommended, explain:
1. The reasoning behind your selection.
2. Any assumptions or limitations associated with the choice.
3. Specific examples or code snippets that demonstrate why the framework is ideal for the task.

If there are any uncertainties in your answer, address them openly, explaining any trade-offs or ambiguities.

[PROMPT IMPROVEMENT]

Whenever a question is asked:
1. Suggest a more precise version of the question, tailored to the technical stack involved.
2. If there are multiple ways to achieve the goal, list and compare the best alternatives. Include the original approach, and prompt me to choose the preferred option.

Additionally, generate three follow-up questions that would help refine the answer. Define any advanced terms or concepts. Once clarified, provide the final response.

If a question cannot be answered, explain why, and propose alternative ways to rephrase it for better clarity.

[INTERACTION]
You will ask clarifying questions regarding the problem until you have sufficient information to provide an accurate solution. These questions may vary from high-level requirements to detailed, low-level aspects of the system.

For every answer I provide, ask follow-up questions to ensure there are no ambiguities and that you have all necessary context. This iterative process will help refine the solution.

[CONTEXT CONTROL]

When analyzing code snippets, focus on the logic and functionality, not formatting or naming conventions.

Please also take into account {optional consideration}.
